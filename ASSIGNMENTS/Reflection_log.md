# Reflection Log in GitHub

## Create a new repository on GitHub

- Go to https://github.com/your-username (replace your-username with your actual username) and click the **Repositories** tab at the top. Click **New** at the right.

It is now time to enter the repository details: 
- Enter a name for your repository, such as "IoT_Reflection_Log". Add a description of your repository.
- Choose whether you want your repository to be public or private. Public repositories are visible to anyone on the internet, while private repositories are only accessible by you and people you invite as collaborators. Your assignments should be private to prevent plagiarism, but projects of which you are proud should be public. For this assignment, make your repository **private**.
- Check the box next to **Add a README file**. This will create a file named `README.md` in your repository, which you can use to describe your project and its features.
- Click on **Create repository**.

## The reflection log

The goal of reflection logging is for you to take a step back and see what you must do to improve.

Write your reflection log file directly from the Web document editor in your GitHub account or using a text editor in your computer.

For each lab and each assignment, create a new file and think about the experience and write a few short sentences stating
- what you have learned,
- what you believe you need to improve,
- what the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier,
- what you could have done to make the learning easier, and
- other reflections that you find relevant to your personal development.

Always list the Linux, Git, and Python commands that you learned and write what you think they do exactly.

Each time you are done writing or making changes to these documents, make sure to stage the changes (add), commit, and push the change.

## Sharing with your teacher

For this private repository to be visible to anyone, you must invite them as a collaborator. To accomplish this for your teacher, whose username is **paquettm**, in your GitHub repository, at https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name/blob/main/hello.py (replace your-username and your-repository-name with your actual values),  
- Click **Settings**
- Click **Collaborators**
- Click **Add people**
- In the text input, enter **paquettm**
- Click on that user in the listing
- Click **Add paquettm to this repository**
